At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/)

## Game Design

Traditional roguelikes are top down, 2d, turn based, dungeon crawling rpgs. There is a lot of flexibility with those criteria and endless discussion but for this tutorial we will stay mostly traditional. The most notable change is we will be using 2d graphics instead of ASCII displays. That means we require art assets as well but luckily there are many quality free or cheap ones available. We will be using an isometric set by Kenney.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack we are using is also unconventional for a roguelike. We will be using google's Flutter framework with Dart which was designed for creating mobile apps but now also can be run on the web and has a desktop target coming out soon. It is not often used for games so we will have some additional work but the library 'Flame' provides us a solid starting point for 2d graphics.

## Additional Resources

TODO: I plan to add a section with links to assets here. For now - Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets) and Open Game Art (http://www.opengameart.org)
are great resources for finding sprites, tilesheets, UI and even music.

I'd like to add some suggestions for more complicated features that you could use to continue expanding on your game. Network, multiplayer, space, more procedural techniques, or in depth simulations.
