## Additional Resources

TODO: I plan to add a section with links to assets here. For now - Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets) and Open Game Art (http://www.opengameart.org)
are great resources for finding sprites, tilesheets, UI and even music.

I'd like to add some suggestions for more complicated features that you could use to continue expanding on your game. Network, multiplayer, space, more procedural techniques, or in depth simulations.
